## Credits
* [FIX94](https://github.com/FIX94) for creating many of the GameCube save file exploits, in which a lot of code from them is used in this project.
* [NWPlayer123](https://github.com/NWPlayer123) for providing information relating to how this game calculates its checksums in the GCI.

## Overview
This is a save exploit for True Crime: Streets of LA. This exploit will load a `boot.dol` converted with `dol2gci` (included in `Home Bros.`) from memory card slot A.

## Usage
Either download a pre-hacked GCI from the [releases page](https://github.com/Zephiles/sola-exploit/releases), or pass a True Crime: Streets of LA GCI to the included Python script to apply the exploit to it.

Once you have the GCI file with the exploit, use a Homebrew app such as [GCMM](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/GCMM) to put both this project's GCI file and the `boot.dol` GCI file onto your memory card. Once the files are on your memory card, you are free to boot up the game like normal. To trigger the exploit, simply select either `New Game` or `Resume Game` on the title screen (`New Game` will trigger the exploit a bit faster).

It is important to note that there are two European versions of this game, and that they both use different game ids. Without looking at the bottom of the disc, the easiest way to tell them apart is by going into the `Options` menu, as the one with id `GTLX52` is the only one that has a `Language` option. Alternatively, both GCI files can be placed onto the memory card instead (`GTLP52.gci` and `GTLX52.gci` if taken from the releases page), as the game will only load the one that corresponds to its game id.

It is also important to note that there is no Japanese GameCube version of this game.

## Prerequisites
`devkitPPC` (can be found [here](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started))  
`Python 3 (any of versions 3.8 through 3.12 due to crc requirement; see below)` (can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). Note that 3.8.1 in particular was used for testing the script in this project.    
`crc` (can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/crc/)). Note that 7.0.0 in particular was used for testing the script in this project.    

## Building
Once the prerequisites are installed, you must add **DEVKITPPC** to your environment, in which it should be set to the `devkitPPC` folder. Once this is done, run `make` in `source`. This will build three separate `bin` files, which will be placed into the `bin` folder. You can also specify specific versions to build by adding additional rules, such as `make us`, `make eu0 eu1`, etc. Once the `bin` files have been built, move them to `bin` folder at the root of this project.

Once the `bin` files are in place, you can pass a True Crime: Streets of LA GCI to `SaveFileHack.py`, in which it will modify the GCI as stated in the `Usage` section.

## Licenses
A lot of files and code used in this project are from **FIX94**'s save file exploit projects, which are licensed under GNU GPL, version 2. Thus, that license is being used for this project.
